# Django Workshop Exercise 6

In this exercise we will expand the "CreatePerson" form from previous exercise to handle the senario where you want to pre-populate the form  with data based on some information (such as the upi of the Person)
<br/><br/>
## 1. Prepare for the coding environment  

SSH into the test machine. The password is 123456.
```sh
ssh your_upi@130.216.39.213
```
Once you are in, activate the python virtual environment and cd into the project folder
```sh
workon dj && cd mysite
```
